    <h1>Palak Panner</h1>

    <p>alak paneer is something I grew up eating. I'm from a Punjabi family, so my mother regularly made it at home. But palak paneer was also a fixture of celebratory meals and occasions, and we'd serve it whenever family members or cousins came to visit—it's very special for us Punjabis. It's almost always included as part of the menu for Punjabi weddings; I can't really remember a single wedding I've attended where palak paneer wasn't served.</p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li> 8 ounces (250g) curly spinach leaves </li>  
        <li>3 tablespoons (45g) ghee or neutral-flavored oil, like sunflower, divided</li>   
        <li>8 ounces (250g) paneer, cut into small rectangles </li>   
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>   
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black mustard seeds</li>   
        <li>3 medium garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>   
        <li>1/2 teaspoon chile powder, such as Kashmiri</li>   
        <li>1 teaspoon (3g) Diamond Crystal kosher salt; if using table salt, use half as much by volume or same weight</li>   
        <li>2 tablespoons (30ml) heavy cream</li>   
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine spinach with 1/2 cup (120ml) water in a 3-quart saucier and place over high heat. Bring water to a boil, cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook until spinach is completely wilted, about 5 minutes. Transfer contents of pan to countertop blender and blend on high speed until completely smooth, about 1 minute. Set purée aside.</li>
        <li>In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, heat 2 tablespoons (30ml) oil over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add half of the paneer pieces and cook, flipping once, until golden, about 2 minutes. Transfer paneer to plate and repeat with remaining paneer pieces. Add remaining tablespoon of ghee to pan along with cumin and mustard seeds and cook until seed begin to pop, about 30 seconds. Add garlic, stir, and cook until aromatic and pieces start to take on some color, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Pour spinach purée into skillet, season with salt and chile powder, and stir to combine. Add cooked paneer and cream, stir, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The process is very simple: I wilt the spinach leaves by cooking them with a little water in a covered pot, then purée them in a blender; this yields a vibrant green puree that's fresh, not murky. I then fry the paneer in some in another pan, set the paneer aside, and in the same pan I heat fry whole mustard and cumin seeds until the seeds start to pop, at which point I add a little minced garlic. I pour the spinach purée into the pan, season it with salt and chile powder, add the fried paneer and a touch of cream, mix, and serve with some kind of piping hot flatbread—chapati, roti, naan, or parathas all would work well.</p>
