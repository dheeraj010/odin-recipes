    <h1>Butter Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../images/butter-chicken.jpg" alt="butter-chicken" width="500px">
    <p>An easy butter chicken recipe I've perfected over the years and shared with many others. The sauce is perfect when creamy and not too thick or too thin. The level of salt and spices can be suited to your taste. Garam and tandoori masala can be found in the ethnic aisle of your grocery store.</p>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
         <li>1 cup butter, divided</li> 
         <li>1 onion, minced</li> 
         <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
         <li>1 (15 ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
         <li>3 cups heavy cream</li>
         <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
         <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
         <li>1 Â½ pounds skinless, boneless</li> 
         <li> chicken breast, cut into bite-sized chunks</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
         <li>2 tablespoons tandoori masala</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onion and garlic, and cook slowly until the onion caramelizes to a dark brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, combine cream, tomato sauce, remaining butter, salt, cayenne pepper, and garam masala in a saucepan over medium-high heat; bring to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes. Stir in caramelized onions.</li>
        <li>While the sauce is simmering, toss chicken with vegetable oil until coated. Season with tandoori masala and spread out onto a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Bake chicken in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 12 minutes. </li>
        <li>Add cooked chicken to the sauce and simmer for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>I have actually made this several times over the years and love it (its taste) but I find it always curdles. It never looks as smooth and creamy as you picture here. Now I must admit, I do not use store bought (anything) tomato sauce, but either diced or crushed tomatoes. Nontheless, I do not understand the curdled look if it.</p>
